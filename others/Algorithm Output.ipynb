    "Graph theory is widely explored and implemented in the field of Computer Science and Mathematics. Consisting of vertices (nodes) and the edges (optionally directed/weighted) that connect them, the data-structure is effectively able to represent and solve many problem domains. One of the most popular areas of algorithm design within this space is the problem of checking for the existence of (shortest) path between two or more vertices in the graph. Properties such as edge weighting and direction are two factors that can be taken\n",

    "A* (pronounced as \"A star\") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. The algorithm efficiently plots a walkable path between multiple nodes, or points, on the graph. The A* algorithm introduces a heuristic into a regular graph-searching algorithm, essentially planning ahead at each step so a more optimal decision is made.\n",

    "A* is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm with some characteristics of breadth-first search (BFS).\n",
    "Like Dijkstra, A* works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the target node. What makes A* different and better for many searches is that for each node, A* uses a function  that gives an estimate of the total cost of a path using that node. Therefore, A* is a heuristic function, which differs from an algorithm in that a heuristic is more of an estimate and is not necessarily provably correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* expands paths that are already less expensive by using this function:\n",

    "f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n",

It’s designed to be a one-way function, infeasible to invert. However, nowadays several hashing algorithms are being compromised. This happened to MD5, for example — a widely known hash function designed to be a cryptographic hash function, which is now so easy to reverse — that we could only use for verifying data against unintentional corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideal cryptographic hash function should have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be fast to compute the hash value for any kind of data\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be impossible to regenerate a message from its hash value (brute force attack as the only option)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should avoid hash collisions, each message has its own hash.\n",
